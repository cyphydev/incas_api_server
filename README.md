# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m uiuc_incas_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker
Generate self-signed certificates and store in directory `certs` (default location)

Edit:
- the environment variables that need configurations are:
    - `INCAS_SRV_PORT`
    - `INCAS_SRV_CERT_PATH`
    - `INCAS_SRV_KEY_PATH`
    - `REDIS_HOST`
    - `REDIS_PORT`
    - `REDIS_PASSWD`
    - `REDIS_USERNAME`

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t uiuc_incas_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 uiuc_incas_server
```
